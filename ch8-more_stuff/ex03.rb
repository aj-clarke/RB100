What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Exception handling is the way in which a program handles an error while the 
program is running. Without exception (error) handling, a program can come to 
a halt, whereas with exception handling, errors can be logged or printed to the 
terminal for further investigation while the program continues functioning.
